"""
Hermetic grid-detection smoke tests for CI.

Unlike test_grid_detection.py (which needs the local captchaimages/ fixtures) and
test_find_grid_corpus.py (which needs the cleanSamples/ real corpus), this module
SYNTHESIZES grid images in memory, so it runs anywhere — no GPU, no network, no
large fixtures. It is the fast guard that protects the core invariant: a clean
NxN grid of distinct-coloured tiles separated by white gutters is detected as an
NxN grid.

find_grid depends only on cv2 + numpy, so this stays cheap and deterministic.
